"""Verify-stage transition handlers.

Verify is owned by :class:`backend.execution.verifier.service.VerificationService`
today. The Run stage's ``RunOrchestrator._verify(...)`` call invokes the
service inline at the end of each plan→act cycle (Lift B2a).

These handlers are the H3+ entry points the driver will use. In H2c
they're thin scaffolding — the verify call has already happened by the
time they fire (inline inside the loop), so the handlers just advance
the coarse state.
