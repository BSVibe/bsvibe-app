"""Worker registry + Redis-Streams consumer wiring (§17.2a slice).

The middle layer between the runtime construction (agent/settle/delivery
factories) and the process lifecycle (signal handlers / boot path):

* :class:`WorkerRuntime` — owns the worker set + its shared engine; runs
  every worker concurrently until stopped.
* :func:`build_worker_runtime` — constructs the full worker set against
  one shared session factory (DB-polling default).
* :func:`check_executor_dispatch_health` — B14 operator liveness probe;
  loud-at-startup warning when an executor pool is configured but Redis
  is not.
* :class:`StreamConsumerBinding` + :func:`build_stream_consumers` +
  :func:`run_stream_consumers` — opt-in Redis-Streams consumer wiring
  (``worker_mode="redis_streams"``). Each consumer loops XREADGROUP →
  the worker's OWN single-tick method → XACK; Redis is only a different
  *trigger* for the same DB-driven logic.

    has configured executor workers (one or more active

    will see every executor run fail this way.

    ``executor_dispatch_no_redis`` WARNING that points operators at the
